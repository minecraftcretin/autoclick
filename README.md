# Hypixel Autoclick
*Simple Python Auto-Clickers for Hypixel Minigames*

This project will be updated on a weekly basis. Some projects are built with the assistance of generative AI and will be indicated. 

Current features are: 
- Randomized automatic left-clicks between minimum and maximum CPS (adjustable)
- Multiple min-max ranges (low frequency and high frequency)
- Trackpad friendly (comma-click and period-click enabled)
- Requires human operation; allow for manual control/adjustment
